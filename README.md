Stockmarket
===========

This program was written in a group for a programming class I took last year.
I'm hoping to improve it and add onto it. But for now, this is what
it does...

The program is a very basic stock market simulation. Up to four players
may buy and sell stock for 10 turns (which may be extended). The values
of each stock change randomly, most likely changing, positively or
negatively, by 50%. There is  a slight chance that the stock value may
change by 75% and an even smaller chance that the stock may double in
value or go completely bankrupt for the remainder of the game.
